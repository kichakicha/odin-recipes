        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a staple in my household. We particularly love <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/valerieskitchen/">this recipe</a> created by 
           Valerie Brunmeier of <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/valerieskitchen/">Valerie's Kitchen on Allrecipes.com</a>!</p>
        <p>The delicious meat sauce married with the ricotta cheese and perfectly cooked noodles (not to mention the slightly crisp, burnt edges) is a
           beautiful melody that will definitely call for a repeat!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 serving cooking spray</li>
            <li>1/2 lb bulk mild Italian sausage</li>

            <li>1 pinch of ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 15oz container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 Tbs dried parsley</li>
            <li>2 24oz jars of marinara sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1 9oz package no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped cremini mushrooms, divided</li>
            <li>1 16oz package shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Place sausage in skillet over medium heat and cook until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain sausage and set aside.</li>
            <li>Step 3: To make bechamel sauce, melt butter in saucepan over medium heat and whisk in the flour. Allow flour and butter to cook until
                light and foamy, about 2 minutes, whisking constantly. Whisk in milk, a little at a time. Whisk in the salt and nutmeg, bring sauce to
                bare simmer, whisking constantly until thickened about 10 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Step 4: In a bowl, beat egg and stir in ricotta cheese and parsley until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Step 5: To assemble lasagna, pour about 1 1/2 cup of marinara sauce into bottom of prepared baking dish and top sauce with 4 lasagna
                noodles, overlapping if necessary. On the noodles, layer 1/3 of ricotta mixture, followed by 1/3 of the cooked sausage and mushrooms, 1/4
                of the bechamel sauce, 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese, 1/8 cup of Parmesan cheese and 1 more cup of marinara sauce. Repeat the layers
                twice more ending with a final layer of noodles topped with a layer of marinara sauce, bechamel sauce, and any remaining mozzarella and 
                Parmesan cheeses.</li>
            <li>Step 6: Cover the dish with foil. Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and noodles are tender, about 1 hour. Remove foil and bake until
                top cheese layer is browned, about 5 minutes. Allow lasagna to stand for 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
        </ol>
