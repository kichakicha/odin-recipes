        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a staple in my household. We particularly love <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/valerieskitchen/">this recipe</a> created by Valerie Brunmeier of <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/valerieskitchen/">Valerie's Kitchen on Allrecipes.com!</a></p>
        <p>The delicious meat sauce married with the ricotta cheese and perfectly cooked noodles (not to mention the slightly crisp, burnt edges) is a beautiful melody that will definitely call for a repeat!</p>
