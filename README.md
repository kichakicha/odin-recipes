======================
- 2021/09/25: Added pages. Also updating the dates on the log because it's not 2020 anymore.
- 2021/09/23: Made changes to homepage (/index.html). Completed recipe page for lasagna (/recipes/lasanga.html), added recipe page for dalgona coffee (/recipes/dalgonacoffee.html) and accompanying photos. Still unsure if I'm doing Git commits correctly. Oh well.
- 2021/09/21: Project start!
